</div>


<p>‘<span class="smcap">A pair</span> of gloves, if you please.’—‘Yes, sir.
Kid gloves?’ The customer indicates the kind
of gloves he requires; and down comes a long
shallow box, divided into several compartments,
in each of which there lies a neat bundle of
gloves of various colours and shades, held together
by a band of paper. ‘What size, sir?’ The
size is mentioned; and one of the bundles is
lifted out of its compartment and quickly and
carefully opened at one end. Gloves of the
exact size and shade required are selected, the
price is paid, and there, for the most part, the
transaction ends. How many of the thousands
who every day go through this process have
any idea of where and how the soft, delicate,
tight-fitting gloves they wear are made?</p>

<p>Enormous numbers—said to exceed two-thirds
of the entire consumption—are imported from
France, Germany, and Sweden. But there is a
large home manufacture, which is carried on to
a considerable extent in and about Worcester,
but principally in the west of England.</p>

<p>If the reader will glance at a railway map,
and let his eye follow the main line of the
London and South-Western Railway, he will find,
about midway between Salisbury and Exeter,
a station marked Yeovil Junction. Should he
actually travel down the line and change at this
junction, he would speedily find himself landed
at the ancient market-town of Yeovil, the centre
and capital of the glove-trade, or as it is locally
described, ‘the gloving’—a town of about eight
thousand inhabitants. A visitor from the North
or the Midlands would probably be surprised, on
entering the gloving metropolis, to find nothing
of the noise or dirt which is usually associated
with manufacturing industry. No tall chimneys
belch out black clouds of smoke; no gaunt
factories rear themselves aloft above the houses;
no ponderous machinery makes its throb felt
even by passers-by in the streets. No obtrusive
signs of the trade which is being carried
on meet the eye anywhere. The place is clean
and bright and quiet; and surrounded by green
hills and luxuriant valleys dotted over with
magnificent timber. Yet it looks—what, indeed,
inquiry proves it to be—a prosperous and thriving
town, presenting a marked and agreeable
contrast to most of the sleepy old towns whose
glory has long since departed, in this beautiful
west country that Kingsley loved so well. In
this respect the capital is a fair sample of all
the gloving centres—a general air of prosperity
pervades them all.</p>

<p>The area over which the trade extends is not
large. A line drawn east and west through Yeovil
and continued for ten miles in each direction
would intersect the whole district, which lies on
the borderland of Somerset and Dorset, and includes
some half-dozen small towns and fair-sized
villages, of which Milborne Port, Sherborne,
Stoke-sub-Hamdon, and Martock are the
principal. Nor can the trade itself be compared
for magnitude with many other industries; it
is a mere pigmy beside the cotton, the iron,
or the woollen trade.</p>

<p>Let us have the pleasure of conducting the
reader over one of the glove factories, fourteen or
fifteen of which may be found in Yeovil alone,
that he may see the present state of one of
the most ancient industries in the country, and
have an idea of the number and variety of the
processes and hands through which his gloves
have passed.</p>

<p>Beginning at the beginning, we enter a room
in which the raw material lies before us in the
shape of hundreds of bundles of sheep-skins
tanned and bleached as white as the driven
snow. Handling them, we find them soft and
elastic to the touch. These are not the skins
of our high-bred English sheep, which are wholly
unfit for the purpose, but the skins of half-wild
mountain-sheep, which are collected by Jews
over the east of Europe and the western part
of Asia. The glover does not care for the skins
of your wool-producing sheep; his dictum is,
‘the rougher the hair, the better the pelt’ (skin).
These skins were formerly imported untanned;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">{226}</span>
but the German tanners have now beaten the
English tanners out of the market, and they
are bought in the condition in which we now
see them here, in Berlin or Vienna. As the
skins are required, they are taken out of the
store and soaked in a vat containing the yolks
of eggs, in the proportion of ten dozen skins to
one gallon of yolks. In order to secure that
every part of the skins shall be thoroughly
soaked, they are trodden by men’s feet. This is
done, it is said, ‘to feed or nourish them;’ or,
in other words, to make them still softer and
more elastic. The soaking over, the skins are
next taken to the dyehouse, and laid face uppermost
on a slightly convex, lead-covered board.
Here they are rapidly and frequently brushed
over with dyestuff until they have absorbed a
sufficient quantity to give them the desired colour,
when they are again brushed with what is called
‘a striker’—that is, a liquid preparation that
will fix and render permanent the dye already
put on them.</p>

<p>The skin is next hung up in a stove or heated
room, where it rapidly dries. When dry, it is
handed over to a man whose business it is to
examine it; and if, as is almost always the case,
it is too thick for the purpose for which it is
intended, or is of unequal thickness, to pare it
down until it is of the required thickness and
of one uniform thickness all over. In some
places this process is carried on in the factory,
but more commonly in an outbuilding attached
to the workman’s home. It is done by means
of a peculiar knife, shaped like a quoit, the
outer edge of which is kept very sharp. Fixing
the skin, by a dexterous movement of the hand,
to a horizontal bar in front of him, he lays
hold of it with the left hand to keep it stretched,
and with the right hand scrapes off so much of
the fleshy matter at the back of it as may be
needed. Considerable skill is required to pare
the skin without cutting it, and should the workman
be awkward, he may not only injure his
work but seriously cut himself.</p>

<p>The skins are next passed under the eye of
an experienced workman, who assorts them into
their various qualities. After this, they are
passed on to another room, where they are first
rolled up in damp cloths, very much after the
manner in which a laundress rolls up clothes
preparatory to wringing the water out of them;
and, when so rolled up, they are vigorously
pulled, so as to develop their utmost stretching
capacity from head to tail. Then they are spread
out on a broad flat table, and carefully, though
very quickly, for the workman’s eye gets exceedingly
sharp, examined for flaws or defects of any
kind, such as the scar left by a wound or thorn-scratch,
or a thin place, which when found is
instantly made into a hole. The examination
over, the cutter has made up his mind how
this particular skin before him can be cut up
to the best advantage—that is, in such a manner
as to leave as little waste as possible. His mind
made up, he lays on a paper pattern, taking
care to place it so that it shall be the right
way of the grain and not across it; then, with
a pair of shears, resembling sheep-shears, he cuts
it into as many oblong squares—each of which is
just large enough for one glove—as the material
will admit of. Out of the parts left he cuts
pieces for the thumbs and fourchettes or sides
of the fingers—usually pronounced ‘forgets’—and
for the binding round the top and the
opening just above the palm of the hand, which
are called ‘welts.’ Having cut a number of
skins, he proceeds to pair the pieces, endeavouring
to match them exactly in colour and quality,
and to make up little bundles containing all
the pieces necessary for each pair of gloves.
This process is one of the most important of
all those through which the leather passes. A
clumsy or careless workman will cut it to waste,
getting several pairs of gloves less out of a dozen
skins than a clever and careful one. As we
watch the process, we are struck with the
rapidity with which the work is done, and with
the skill shown in dealing with flaws in the
leather. Here, for example, is a skin with a
hole in the best part of it about the size of a
shilling; with seeming rashness, the man cuts
the leather so that that very hole comes into
one of the oblong squares. We call attention
to the fact, when, with a smile, he points out
that at that precise point a hole will be required
for the thumb-piece.</p>

<p>The pieces of leather, called in the trade
‘trancs’—for they are no longer skins—are
now passed on to another room, where they
are cut into their final shape. Hitherto, we
have been dealing with the preparation of
the material for gloves, and a stranger might
have followed all the processes so far without
gathering from what he saw any indication of
the use to be made of these pieces of leather.
But now they begin to assume a shape which
cannot be mistaken. The reader, especially the
fair reader, has doubtless often seen, if not used,
the shapes with which pastry is cut into leaves,
circles, squares, and so on. Now, if you will put
your two hands together, palms uppermost, and
imagine a shape that would cut out the figure
made by these two hands, minus the thumbs,
and treating the two little fingers as one, you
will have a very fair idea of a glover’s punch or
‘web.’ In the room we now enter we find quite
a number of these punches, agreeing with the
number of sizes manufactured. One of them is
laid on a sliding table edge uppermost; then six
of these oblong squares of leather—which have
been placed face to face in pairs, so that right
and left hand gloves may be cut together—are
laid upon it, and covered with a thick pad of
wood or vulcanite. The table is pushed forward
until the punch and its burden rest under an
iron press, not unlike a printing-press. One pull
at the powerful lever, and the press comes down,
and the leather is cut. The thumb-pieces are
next treated in the same manner. Up the back
of every pair of gloves there are three lines of
ornamental work of some kind. If these gloves
are to have the heavy silk-work on the back
called tambouring, they will now be laid upon
a block and punctured with as many holes as
there are to be stitches in the tambour-work.
Before leaving this room, the size of the gloves
is stamped on the inside of one, and a consecutive
or matching number is written inside each of
the two pieces of leather that are now an embryo
pair of gloves, so that if, in any of the subsequent
processes, they should be accidentally separated,
they may be identified and brought together<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">{227}</span>
again. After they have been looked over and
carefully perfected with scissors wherever the
punch may have left a jagged edge, they are
ready to resume their travels.</p>

<p>Tied up in bundles of a dozen, they are given
to women, who do the ornamental work on the
back of the gloves. Some of these women work
on the premises, and others at home. Most of
the tambouring, which is very popular, is done
in cottage homes. Entering one of these cottages,
you may see a woman rocking a cradle with
one foot, and giving an occasional glance at the
dinner cooking on the fire, while she bends over
a frame on which the gloves are stretched, and
with a crochet-hook, and apparently little more
attention than a knitter gives to her stocking,
she quickly adds those three times three rows
of silk-work up what will be the back of the
gloves. Carrying back the gloves to the factory,
she will receive ninepence a dozen for her
work.</p>

<p>The gloves are next given out to other women,
who also work at home, to be stitched—that is,
to have the fingers completed and the thumbs
put in. This is now nearly all done by a
recently invented and cleverly adapted sewing-machine,
the needle of which comes down on
the tip of an upright iron finger. Gloves are
not all stitched in the immediate neighbourhood
of the factories, but are often sent long distances
into remote country villages, where, work being
scarce, labour is cheap. And to facilitate this, a
class of middle men (or women) has grown up—people
who come in from the country to the
factories, and take away a hundred or a hundred
and fifty dozen a week, which they distribute
among the women of the village in which they
live, collect again when finished, and bring back
to the factory. These putters-out or bagmen are
paid the usual price, some half-crown a dozen
for the stitching, and make their own bargain
with the actual workers. They are generally
supposed to make a profit of about threepence
a dozen; but, as a matter of fact, being shopkeepers,
they commonly make two profits—one
on the gloves, and another on the goods the
sewers purchase at their shops. These people
have a somewhat difficult part to play, as they
stand between two fires; but they are a most
useful class, and carry work and its rewards into
many villages where, but for them, they would
never come. They have done much to stay the
exodus of the population from this part of the
agricultural districts, enabling parents to keep
their young people, and especially their young
women, at home, instead of sending them to the
great towns to seek for employment.</p>

<p>Having come back from the stitchers, the
gloves are sent out once more. If they are
heavy winter gloves, they are sent out to be
lined with warm soft cotton material. If they
are lighter goods, they are at once despatched
to be welted—that is, to have the binding put
round the top and the opening at the wrist.
The buttons or clasps, as the case may be, are
next added; that done, they come back to the
factory for the last time, and pass the final
examination.</p>

<p>They have still a rough, tumbled, unfinished
look, which would prove anything but tempting
to a purchaser. They are now forwarded to
the laying-out room, where they are stretched
with ordinary glove-stretchers, and then put on
heated steel hands, which take out all the creases
and improve their appearance. Nothing now
remains but to assort them, to put them up in
neat bundles according to size, to pack them in
boxes, and to send them to market.</p>

<p>The special gloves that we have been following
through all their stages are those which are
known in the trade as ‘grain’ goods, and are
sold to the public under the name of dogskin,
Cape, and other names, each name indicating
some peculiarity in the quality and finish of the
leather. Many other kinds of gloves are made
in the district, such as calf and buck and doe
skin; the calf gloves are made from English calf-skins,
and the buck and doe from English lambskins.
There is also a large manufacture of fabric
gloves—in other words, of gloves made of cotton,
woollen, silk, or merino material. Real kid,
however, is nowhere made in this district. The
processes through which leather gloves of every
kind pass are very much the same as those
described above, and the manufacture of fabric
gloves differs only in the comparative fewness
of its stages, beginning with the process of punching
the material into the required shape. After
that, its course is undistinguishable from that of
the manufacture of leather gloves.</p>

<p>There are altogether about five-and-twenty factories
in the district, ranging from one which
claims to be the largest glove factory in the world,
and is capable of turning out forty thousand pairs
per week, to some which produce only from five
hundred to a thousand pairs in the same time.
These factories give employment to nearly ten
thousand persons, five-sixths of whom are women.
Only about a quarter of the employees work in
the factories; the rest take the work home, and
in many cases do it in time which would otherwise
be wasted. By thus finding employment
for the wives and daughters of an immense
number of agricultural labourers—an employment
which in no way interferes with their domestic
duties—the gloving brings a large amount of
comfort into the homes of the peasantry of the
west, and alleviates a lot which would under
other circumstances be hard and hopeless in the
extreme.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIX.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was the very next day when the governor’s
wife came to call. In any case, Lady Modyford
would have had to call on Marian; for etiquette
demands, from the head of the colony at least,
a strict disregard for distinctions of cuticle, real
or imaginary. But Nora Dupuy had seen Lady
Modyford that very morning, and had told her
all the absurd story of the Hawthorns’ social
disqualifications. Now, the governor’s wife was
a woman of the world, accustomed to many
colonial societies, big and small, as well as to
the infinitely greater world of London; and she
was naturally moved, at first hearing, rather to
amusement than to indignation at the idea of
Tom Dupuy setting himself up as the social
superior of a fellow of Catherine’s and barrister<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">{228}</span>
of the Inner Temple. This point of view itself
certainly lost nothing from Nora’s emphatic way
of putting it; for, though Nora had herself a
bountiful supply of fine old crusted West Indian
prejudices, producible on occasion, and looked
down upon ‘brown people’ of every shade with
that peculiarly profound contempt possible only
to a descendant of the old vanquished slave-owning
oligarchy, yet her personal affection for
Marian and Edward was quite strong enough to
override all such abstract considerations of invisible
colour; and her sense of humour was quite
keen enough to make her feel the full ridiculousness
of comparing such a man as Edward Hawthorn
with her own loutish sugar-growing cousin.
She had lived so long in England, as Tom
Dupuy himself would have said, that she had
begun to pick up at least some faint tincture of
these newfangled Exeter Hall opinions; in other
words, she had acquired a little ballast of common-sense
and knowledge of life at large to weigh
down in part her tolerably large original cargo of
colonial prejudices.</p>

<p>But when Nora came to tell Lady Modyford,
as far as she knew them, the indignities to which
the Hawthorns had already been subjected by
the pure blue blood of Trinidad, the governor’s
wife began to perceive there was more in it
than matter for mere laughter; and she bridled
up a little haughtily at the mention of Mr Tom
Dupuy’s free-spoken comments, as overheard by
Nora on the Orange Grove piazza. ‘Nigger
people!’ the fat, good-natured, motherly, little
body echoed, angrily. ‘Did he say nigger people,
my dear?—What! a daughter of General Ord
of the Bengal infantry—why, I came home from
Singapore in the same steamer with her mother,
the year my father went away from the Straits
Settlements to South Australia! Do you mean
to say, my dear, they won’t call upon her,
because she’s married a son of that nice old Mr
Hawthorn with the white beard up at Agualta!
A perfect gentleman, too! Dear me, how very
abominable! You must excuse my saying it,
my child, but really you West Indian people do
mistake your own little hole and corner for the
great world, in a most extraordinary sort of a
fashion. Now, confess to me, don’t you?’</p>

<p>So the same afternoon, Lady Modyford had
powdered her round, fat, little face, and put on
her pretty coquettish French bonnet, and driven
round in full state from Government House to
Edward Hawthorn’s new bungalow in the Westmoreland
valleys.</p>

<p>As the carriage with its red-liveried black
footmen drove up to the door, Marian’s heart
sank once more within her: she knew it was
the governor’s wife come to call; and she had
a vague presentiment in her own mind that the
fat little woman inside the carriage would send
in her card out of formal politeness, and drive
away at once without waiting to see her. But
instead of that, Lady Modyford came up the
steps with great demureness, and walked into
the bare drawing-room, after Marian’s rather
untidy and quite raw black waiting-maid; and
the moment she saw Marian, she stepped up to
her very impulsively, and held out both her
hands, and kissed the poor young bride on either
cheek with genuine tenderness. ‘My dear,’ she
said, with a motherly tremor in her kind old
voice, ‘you must forgive me for making myself
quite at home with you at once, and not standing
upon ceremony in any way; but I knew your
mother years ago—she was just like you then—and
I know what a lonely thing it is for a newly
married girl to come out to a country like this,
quite away from her own people; and I shall
be so glad if you’ll take Sir Adalbert and me
just as we are. We’re homely people, and we
don’t live far away from you; and if you’ll
run round and see me any time you feel lonely
or are in want of anything, why, you know,
of course, my dear, we shall be delighted to
see you.’</p>

<p>And then, before Marian could wipe away
the tears that rose quickly to her eyes, fat little
Lady Modyford had gone off into reminiscences
of Singapore and Bombay, and that dear Mrs
Ord, and the baby that died—‘Your sister, you
know, my dear—the one that was born at Calcutta,
and died soon after your dear mamma
reached England.—No, of course, my dear; your
mamma couldn’t know that I was here, because,
you see, when she and I came home together—why,
that was twenty-two years ago—no, twenty-four,
I declare, because Sir Adalbert—he was
plain Mr Modyford then, on three hundred a
year, in the Straits Settlements colonial service—didn’t
propose to me till the next summer,
when he came home on leave, you know,
just before he was removed to Hong-kong by
that horrid Lord Modbury, who was Colonial
Secretary in those days, and afterwards died
of suppressed gout, the doctors said, at his own
villa at that delightful Spezzia. So you see
I was Kitty Fitzroy at that time, my child;
and I daresay your mamma, who’s older than
me a good bit, of course, never heard about
my marrying Sir Adalbert, for we were married
very quietly down in Devonshire, where Sir
Adalbert’s father was a rector in a very small
parish, on a tiny income; and we started at once
for Hong-kong, and spent our honeymoon at
Venice—a nasty, damp, uncomfortable place for
a wedding tour, I call it, but not nearly so
bad as you coming out here straight from the
church door almost, Miss Dupuy told me; and
Trinidad too, well known to be an unsociable,
dead-alive sort of an island. But whenever you
like, dear, you must just jump on your horse—you’ve
got horses, of course?—yes, I thought
so—and ride over to Government House, and
have a good chat with me and Emily; for,
indeed, Mrs Hawthorn—what’s your Christian
name?—Marian—ah, very pretty—we should like
to see you as often as you choose; and next
week, after you’ve settled down a little, you
must really come up and stop some time with
us; for I assure you I have quite taken a fancy
to you, my dear; and Sir Adalbert, when he
saw Mr Hawthorn the other day, at the Island
Secretary’s office, came home quite delighted,
and said to me: “Kitty, the young man they’ve
sent out for the new District judge is the
very man to keep that something old fool
Dupuy in order in future.”’</p>

<p>Lady Modyford waited a good deal longer
than is usual with a first call, and got very
friendly indeed with poor Marian before the
end of her visit; for coarse-grained woman of
the world as she was, her heart warmed not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">{229}</span>
a little towards the friendless young bride who
had come out to Trinidad—dull hole, Trinidad,
not at all like Singapore, or Mauritius, or Cape
Town—to find herself so utterly deserted by
all society. And next day, all female Trinidad
was talking, over five-o’-clock tea, about the
remarkable fact, learnt indirectly through those
unrecognised purveyors of fashionable intelligence,
the servants, that that horrid proud Lady
Modyford—‘who treats you and me, my dear,
as if we were the dirt beneath her feet, don’t
you know, and must call with two footmen
and so much grandeur and formality’—had actually
kissed that brown man’s wife, that’s to
be the new District judge in Westmoreland, on
both cheeks, the very first moment she saw her.
Female Trinidad was so inexpressibly shocked
at this disgraceful behaviour in a person officially
charged with the maintenance of a high
standard of decorum, that it was really half
inclined to think it ought to cut Lady Modyford
direct on next meeting her. It was restrained
from this extreme measure, however, by a wholesome
consideration of the fact that Lady Modyford
would undoubtedly take the rebuff with
unruffled amusement; so it contented itself by
merely showing a little coldness to the governor’s
wife when it happened to meet her, and refusing
to enter into conversation with her on the subject
of Marian and Edward Hawthorn.</p>

<p>As for Marian herself, she had a good cry, as
soon as Lady Modyford was gone, over this interview
also. Kind as the governor’s wife had
wished to show herself, and genuinely sympathetic
as she had actually been, Marian couldn’t
help recognising that there was a certain profound
undercurrent of degradation in having to
accept the ready sympathy of such a woman at
all on such a matter. Anywhere else, Marian
would have felt that Lady Modyford, motherly
as she was, stood just a grade or two by nature
below her; in fact, she felt so there too; but
still, she was compelled by circumstances to take
the good fat body’s consolation and condolence
as a sort of favour; while anywhere else she
would rather have repelled it as a disagreeable
impertinence, or at least as a distasteful interference
with her own individuality. It was
impossible not to be dimly conscious that coming
to Trinidad had made a real difference in her own
social position. At home, she had no need for
anybody’s condescension or anybody’s affability;
here, she was forced to recognise the fact that
even Lady Modyford was making generous concessions
on purpose in her favour. It was galling,
but it was inevitable. There is nothing more
painful to persons who have always mixed in
society on terms of perfect and undoubted equality,
than thus to put themselves into false positions,
where it is possible for equals, or even for natural
inferiors, to seem to patronise them.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, that evening, Marian said to
Edward very firmly: ‘Edward, you must make
up your mind to stop in Trinidad. I shall never
feel so much confidence again in your real courage
if you turn and run from Nora’s father. Besides,
now Lady Modyford has called, and Nora has
been here, I daresay we shall get a little society
of our own—people who know too much about
the outer world to be wholly governed by the
fads and fancies of Trinidad planters.’</p>

<p>And Edward answered in a somewhat faltering
voice: ‘Very well, my darling. One’s duty
lies that way, I know; and if you’re strong
enough to stand up and face it, why, I must
try to face it also.’</p>

<p>And they did face it, with less difficulty even
than they at first imagined. Presently, Mrs
Castello came to call, the wife of the governor’s
aide-de-camp: a pretty, pleasant, sisterly little
woman, who struck up a mutual attachment with
Marian almost at first sight, and often dropped
in to see them afterwards. Then one or two
others of the English officials brought their wives;
and before long, when Marian went to stay at
Government House, it was clear that in the
imported official society at anyrate the Hawthorns
were to be at least tolerated. Toleration
is a miserable sort of standing for people to submit
to; but in the last resort, it is better than
isolation. And as time went on, the toleration
grew into friendliness and intimacy in many
quarters, though never among the native planter
aristocracy. Those noble people, intensely proud
of their pure white blood, held themselves entirely
aloof with profound dignity. ‘Poor souls!’
Sir Adalbert Modyford said contemptuously to
Captain Castello, ‘they forget how little it is
to be proud of, and that every small street arab
in London could consider himself a gentleman
in Trinidad on the very self-same grounds of
birth as they do.’</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CONSCIENTIOUS_MONEY-SPENDING">CONSCIENTIOUS MONEY-SPENDING.</h2>
</div>


<p>‘<span class="smcap">Never</span> treat money affairs with levity—money
is character.’ It is to be feared that many neglect
this wise caution, and do not put conscience into
the spending of their money, whatever they may
do as regards the making of it. Rich people
think that it is good for trade to be free-handed
with wealth, and do not always distinguish
between productive and unproductive expenditure.
They are frequently guilty of demoralising
the poorer classes by careless almsgiving and
the bad example of their thoughtless money-spending.</p>

<p>Of course, so far as they are influenced by
religious considerations, the rich recognise the
truth that all their possessions are held in trust,
and only lent to them by a superior Power for
the service of their fellow-beings. But the rich
have difficulties as well as the poor, and one of
these lies in determining how to distribute their
expenditure in a way that shall prove beneficial
to society. The question, ‘To whom or to what
cause shall I contribute money?’ must be a very
anxious one to conscientious men of wealth.
‘How are we to measure,’ we may suppose rich
men to ask, ‘the relative utility of charities?
And then political economists are down upon
us if, by mistake, we help those who might
have helped themselves. It is easy to talk
against our extravagance; tell us rather how to
spend our money advantageously—that is to
say, for the greatest good of the greatest number.’
The fact is, riches must now be considered by
all good men as a distinct profession, with
responsibilities no less onerous than those of
other professions. And this very difficult profession
of wealth ought to be learned by studying
social science and otherwise with as much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">{230}</span>
care as the professions of divinity, law, and
medicine are learned. When in this way the
rich accept and prepare themselves for the
duties of their high calling, it will cease to be
a cause of complaint that, in the nature of
things, money tends to fall into the hands of
a few large capitalists.</p>

<p>Nor is the money-spending of the poor less
careless than that of the rich. During the time
of high wages, labouring people buy salmon and
green peas when they are barely in season; and
Professor Leone Levi computes that their annual
drink-bill amounts to thirty-six millions. That
is exactly the sum which the working-classes
spend in rent; so, although better houses are the
strongest and most imperative demands for the
working-classes, those classes are spending, on the
lowest estimate, a sum equal to what they are
spending on rent.</p>

<p>Some two years ago, an eminent London
physician went into Hyde Park and sat down
upon a bench, and there sat down by him a
pauper eighty years of age. The physician
entered into conversation with him, and asked
him what his trade was. The man said he was
a carpenter.</p>

<p>‘A very good trade indeed. Well, how is it
that you come at this time of life to be a
pauper? Have you been addicted to drink?’</p>

<p>‘Not at all; I have only taken my three pints
a day—never spent more than sixpence daily.’</p>

<p>The physician, taking out a pencil and a piece
of paper, asked: ‘How long have you continued
this practice of drinking three pints of ale a day?’</p>

<p>‘I am now eighty, and I have continued that
practice, more or less, for sixty years.’</p>

<p>‘Very well,’ continued the physician, ‘I will
just do the sum.’ He found that sixpence a
day laid by for sixty years amounted, with compound
interest, to three thousand two hundred
and twenty-six pounds; and he said to the old
carpenter: ‘My good man, instead of being a
pauper, you might have been the possessor of
three thousand two hundred and twenty-six
pounds at this moment; in other words, you
might have had one hundred and fifty pounds
a year, or some three pounds a week, not by
working an hour longer or doing anything
differently, except by putting by the money
that you have been spending day by day these
sixty years on ale.’ The physician’s conclusion,
however, should perhaps be modified by the
consideration that if this man had ceased spending
sixpence on beer, he might have required to
spend a portion of that sixpence on an increased
supply of food. But notwithstanding this, the
physician’s argument is in the main a sound one.</p>

<p>It is not ‘ologies’ that the working-classes
require to be taught so much, as the right use
of money and the good things that can be purchased
with it. It often astonishes the rich to
see the wasteful expenditure of the poor; but
an explanation will be found in the caution
which Dr Johnson gives to men who fancy that
poor girls must necessarily make the most
economical wives. ‘A woman of fortune,’ he
says, ‘being used to the handling of money,
spends it judiciously; but a woman who gets
the command of money for the first time upon
her marriage, has such a gust in spending, that
she throws it away with great profusion.’ That
was excellent advice also which Dr Johnson gave
to Boswell, when the latter inherited his paternal
estates. ‘You, dear sir, have now a new station,
and have therefore new cares and new employments.
Life, as Cowley seems to say, ought to
resemble a well-ordered poem; of which one
rule generally received is, that the exordium
should be simple and should promise little.
Begin your new course of life with the least
show and the least expense possible; you may
at pleasure increase both, but you cannot easily
diminish them. Do not think your estate your
own while any man can call upon you for
money which you cannot pay; therefore begin
with timorous parsimony. Let it be your first
care not to be in any man’s debt.’</p>

<p>People beginning to keep house should be
careful not to pitch their scale of expenditure
higher than they can hope to continue it, and
they should remember that, as Lord Bacon said,
‘it is less dishonourable to abridge petty charges
than to stoop to petty gettings.’</p>

<p>What an admirable manager of money was
Mrs Carlyle! ‘There was,’ writes Mr Froude,
‘a discussion some years ago in the newspapers
whether two people with the habits of a lady
and a gentleman could live together in London
on three hundred pounds a year. Mrs Carlyle,
who often laughed about it while it was going
on, will answer the question. No one who visited
the Carlyles could tell whether they were poor
or rich. There were no signs of extravagance,
but also none of poverty. The drawing-room
arrangements were exceptionally elegant. The
furniture was simple, but solid and handsome;
everything was scrupulously clean; everything
good of its kind; and there was an air of ease,
as of a household living within its means. Mrs
Carlyle was well dressed always. Her admirable
taste would make the most of inexpensive
materials; but the materials themselves were of
the very best. Carlyle himself generally kept
a horse. They travelled, they visited, they were
always generous and open-handed.’ All this was
done on an income of not quite four hundred
pounds. Of course Carlyle, as well as his wife,
was imbued with Scotch thrift, showing itself
in hatred of waste. If he saw a crust of bread
on the roadway, he would stop to pick it up,
and put it on a step or a railing. ‘Some poor
creature might be glad of it, or at worst a dog
or a sparrow. To destroy wholesome food is a
sin.’</p>

<p>The thrifty wife of Benjamin Franklin felt it
a gala day indeed when, by long accumulated
small savings, she was able to surprise her
husband one morning with a china cup and a
silver spoon from which to take his breakfast.
Franklin was shocked. ‘You see how luxury
creeps into families in spite of principles,’ he
said. When his meal was over, he went to the
store and rolled home a wheelbarrow full of
papers through the streets with his own hands,
lest folk should get wind of the china cup and
say he was above his business.</p>

<p>It is a great blessing to have been trained
hardily. Those who have few wants are rich.
Hundreds of middle-class people are heavily
handicapped in the race of life because they
find it hard to do without luxuries which they
can ill afford to buy, but which they would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">{231}</span>
never have missed if they had not been accustomed
to them in childhood. This must become
every year more apparent, because the classes
that have hitherto had the monopoly of education
have now to compete with the working-classes
trained to privation for generations.</p>

<p>But although the creeping-in of luxury should
be guarded against at the commencement of
married life, people should learn how to grow
rich gracefully. It is no part of wisdom to
depreciate the little elegances and social enjoyment
of our homes. These things refine manners
and enlarge the heart. A gentleman told Dr
Johnson that he had bought a suit of lace for
his wife. The Doctor said: ‘Well, sir, you have
done a good thing and a wise thing.’ ‘I have
done a good thing,’ said the gentleman; ‘but I
do not know that I have done a wise thing.’
‘Yes, sir,’ continued the Doctor; ‘no money is
better spent than what is laid out for domestic
satisfaction. A man is pleased that his wife is
dressed as well as other people; and a wife is
pleased that she is so dressed.’</p>

<p>We should be particular about money, but
not penurious. The mistress of a well-ordered
house takes broad and liberal views of things,
and while cutting her coat according to her cloth,
and as much as possible shielding her husband
from the constant demand for money, which few
masculine tempers can stand, she refrains from
the wearying, petty economies which often enough
are not worth the trouble and discomfort they
entail. Economy is altogether different from
penuriousness; for it is economy that can always
best afford to be generous. Those who are
careless about personal expenditure are often
driven in the end to do very shabby things.
Burns tells us that, ‘for the glorious privilege of
being independent,’ we should ‘gather gear by
every wile that’s justified by honour.’</p>

<p>‘Do not accustom yourself,’ said Dr Johnson,
‘to consider debt only as an inconvenience; you
will find it a calamity.’ Only the other day
the writer was speaking to an officer in the army
who was so far from considering the debt which
he owed to his tailor as either an inconvenience
or a calamity, that he seemed to be quite proud
of it. ‘My tailor,’ said he, ‘never duns me for
the money. When I have a pound or two which
I don’t want, I send it to him, just as other
people put it in a bank.’ It was no use telling
him that five or ten per cent. on the amount of
his bill was being charged every year, and that
on a day when he least expected it, payment
would be demanded. Had this officer never heard
of the General Order which was issued by Sir
Charles Napier, in taking leave of his command
in India? Sir Charles strongly urged in that
famous document that ‘honesty is inseparable
from the character of a thorough-bred gentleman;’
and that ‘to drink unpaid-for champagne
and unpaid-for beer, and to ride unpaid-for
horses, is to be a cheat, and not a gentleman.’</p>

<p>Men who lived beyond their means might be
officers by virtue of their commissions, but they
were not gentlemen. The habit of being
constantly in debt, the general held, made men
grow callous to the proper feelings of a gentleman.
It was not enough that an officer should be able
to fight; that, any bulldog could do. But did he
hold his word inviolate? Did he pay his debts?
He should be as ready to utter his valiant ‘No,’
or ‘I can’t afford it,’ to the invitations of pleasure
and self-enjoyment, as to mount a breach amidst
belching fire and the iron hail of machine-guns.</p>

<p>The Duke of Wellington kept an accurate
detailed account of all the moneys received and
expended by him. ‘I make a point,’ said he, ‘of
paying my own bills, and I advise every one to
do the same. Formerly, I used to trust a
confidential servant to pay them; but I was
cured of that folly by receiving one morning, to
my great surprise, duns of a year or two’s
standing. The fellow had speculated with my
money and left my bills unpaid.’ Talking of
debt, his remark was: ‘It makes a slave of a
man. I have often known what it was to be in
want of money, but I never got into debt.’
Washington was as particular as Wellington in
matters of business detail, and he did not disdain
to scrutinise the smallest outgoings of his household—determined
as he was to live honestly
within his means—even while holding the high
office of President of the American Union.</p>

<p>To provide for others and for our own comfort
and independence in old age, is honourable, and
greatly to be commended; but to hoard for mere
wealth’s sake is the characteristic of the narrow-souled
and the miserly. ‘We must carry money
in the head, not in the heart;’ that is to say, we
must not make an idol of it, but regard it as a
useful agent.</p>

<p>Some of the finest qualities of human nature
are intimately related to the right use of money,
such as generosity, honesty, justice, and self-sacrifice,
as well as the practical virtues of
economy and providence. On the other hand,
there are their counterparts of avarice, fraud,
injustice, and selfishness, as displayed by the
inordinate lovers of gain; and the vices of
thriftlessness, extravagance, and improvidence, on
the part of those who misuse and abuse the
means intrusted to them. ‘So that,’ as it has
been well said, ‘a right measure and manner in
getting, saving, spending, giving, taking, lending,
borrowing, and bequeathing, would almost argue
a perfect man.’</p>

</div>


<h3 title="CHAPTER II.">IN TWO CHAPTERS.—CHAP. II.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">I obeyed</span> Miss Cleabyrn’s injunction not to follow
her, though I wished to restore the watch and
chain she had left with me; but I strained my
gaze in the direction she had taken. In the continued
bellowing of the wind and through the
driving rain, it was difficult to hear or see anything,
even when close at hand; yet I fancied I
could hear her footsteps, as she reached the lane
which was at the foot of the railway bank, and
could see her.—Yes! again I heard footsteps;
but surely they were not hers; and the vague,
shadowy glimpse of a form I obtained was not
Beatrice Cleabyrn, and—I might be confused by
the rain; but if not, there were <i>two</i> others.</p>

<p>It was in vain to strain my sight any longer;
I could see and hear no more, so I returned to
my duties; and in the morning I might almost
have persuaded myself that all had been a dream,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">{232}</span>
but for the presence of the articles which Miss
Cleabyrn had left with me.</p>

<p>I felt at liberty, and indeed felt bound to take
my mother into the secret, as her house would
probably be the place of refuge for the captain;
but I did not tell her all I have now said. She
was not informed of what I well knew was the
true reason for Miss Cleabyrn seeking me out
and intrusting me with so dangerous a secret.</p>

<p>The old lady, who was a confirmed student of
the newspaper, and had long been interested in
the fate and fortunes of the captain, was glad to
have the chance of being of service to him, and
arranged at once where he should sleep. We had
not much choice, our cottage being but of four
rooms.</p>

<p>My mate told me, when I went on duty, that
it was rumoured at the <i>Chequers</i> that Captain
Laurenston was in the neighbourhood for certain,
and would be caught, worse luck! It was
impossible that he could get away, there was
such a lot on the lookout for him. I returned
some indifferent answer, for, of course, I could
not tell him how terribly I could have corroborated
his tale. I could, however, and did,
echo his last wish at leaving, that the officer
might beat all his enemies.</p>

<p>It was again a soaking wet night; the wind had
gone down, so that the rain did not drive as on
the previous day, and there was no violence in
the downpour, but it was steady and drenching
enough. The usual passenger and goods trains
had passed, and I grew nervous with expectancy.
No idea had been given me as to when Captain
Laurenston would make his appearance; but I
could not help thinking it would be about the
same time as my visitor had come on the previous
evening; and I was right.</p>

<p>I took the precaution to turn my lamp down
a little, so as to diminish the light; for there was
no knowing what eyes might be on the watch, and
I was standing at the entrance to my hut, striving
to pierce the darkness, when I was startled by two
figures coming suddenly before me. I knew them.
They entered, and I closed the door.</p>

<p>‘Thank heaven, you are safe, so far, Oswald!’
exclaimed the lady—Miss Cleabyrn, of course—‘and
I know you can confide in our friend
Waltress; so I trust you are out of the toils.’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ said the captain, turning to me and
grasping my hand. I knew him by his voice
and by Miss Cleabyrn’s words; but had we
met casually, I assuredly should not have recognised
him. His glossy moustache and full
whiskers were gone, while a light wig hid what
was left of his dark curls. ‘I know I can trust
him,’ he said; ‘I knew it the first time I saw
his face.—But leave me now, dearest; it will
only be for a time—a short time, ere we meet
again. Thank our friend Waltress, and let us
say farewell.’</p>

<p>Miss Cleabyrn offered her hand—there was
such a queer thrill in my own veins as I touched
it, such a recalling of past days!—and she said
a few words expressive of her gratitude. These
were only few; but with her soft voice in my
ears, and the sight of her now swimming eyes
before me, I would have dared death in her
service.</p>

<p>She then threw her arms round the captain’s
neck, and strove to frame a farewell, but broke
down terribly, so that for a few minutes she was
hysterical, and I dreaded lest she might scream
aloud, and thus give the alarm to any chance
traveller, or, it might be, any concealed watcher.
But she recovered herself as quickly as she had
broken down, dashed the tears from her eyes,
gave one passionate kiss, and then fled into
the darkness.</p>

<p>‘My poor dear girl,’ said the captain, with
some hesitation in his voice, as he gazed after
her. ‘I feel that I ought to have gone with
her, and yet I know it would have been madness.—We
were traced here, Waltress, for all
I know; the watch upon me has been very
close.’</p>

<p>I told him how I fancied I had seen two
persons, when Miss Cleabyrn had left my box
on the previous night.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ he said, with a smile; ‘I joined her
at the foot of the bank. But you must have
good eyes.’</p>

<p>I explained that he misunderstood me; that
I thought I had seen two persons follow the
lady, although, in such a storm and in the
darkness, it was impossible to be certain. He
was a good deal disturbed at hearing this, being
evidently at once convinced that my suspicions
were well founded.</p>

<p>He had not been long in my hut, and we
were talking about the best method of first
concealing him and then getting him away, when
I suddenly stopped in my speech and listened
at the door.</p>

<p>‘What is the matter?’ asked Laurenston.</p>

<p>‘I heard a step of some one walking round
the box,’ I returned; ‘and I am sure there is
a man on the rails. No one has any business
there at this time.’</p>

<p>In another instant a low whistle was heard.</p>

<p>‘They mean mischief,’ I said; ‘you are caged!
These men are following you.’</p>

<p>The captain turned pale, and thrust his hand
into his breast.</p>

<p>I guessed he had some weapon concealed
there, so I exclaimed: ‘That will not do!—Here!
There is just one chance; put on this coat and
cap.’ They were those left by my mate.—‘Quick!’
I cried; ‘I can hear them coming!—Now,
sit down, and write anything in this
book. Don’t seem to shrink from’——</p>

<p>A sharp rap at the door interrupted me.
Before I could answer it, the door was thrown
open, and I saw three men—strangers—before
me. Another was standing at some distance, so
that I could not see him distinctly.</p>

<p>‘Your name is Waltress,’ said the foremost
sharply, and with a quick glance round the
interior of the hut. ‘We are in pursuit of a
criminal, and have traced him to this spot.—Have
you seen any stranger here?’</p>

<p>‘I have not been here all the evening,’ I
said; ‘but no one has been here except—— Bill!’
I exclaimed to my supposed mate, ‘have
you seen any fellows hanging about here?’</p>

<p>‘Bill’ turned half round; but the peak of his
cap being drawn down over his face, and the
collar of his coat being turned up, as was natural<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">{233}</span>
on such a night, he was effectually disguised,
especially as his appearance was, as I have
described, so completely changed. He spoke
with his pen in his mouth, and said: ‘About
three hours ago there was a fellow at the gates
that I didn’t like the look of.’</p>

<p>‘We have seen our man, or he has been seen,
since then,’ returned the speaker. Then addressing
those behind, he said: ‘He may be hiding in
those trucks,’ pointing to some on the other side
of the line.</p>

<p>At that moment a man was really heard to
leap from one of the trucks and to hurry along
the road. I knew who it was, and that it was
his duty to see to certain arrangements, before
the train came through which would pick them
up. The man who was standing apart also heard
the noise, and called to the others; then, without
another word, they all hurried to where the
trucks were standing.</p>

<p>‘A near chance that,’ I said, turning to the
captain, but stopped in my speech, from the
shock his changed appearance gave me. He was
deathly pale.</p>

<p>I began to feel more uneasy in my new undertaking
than I had hitherto been, especially when
I heard another step approaching and saw that
some one bearing a light was coming to the hut.</p>

<p>I thought it was a second search, and felt that
we could scarcely expect to repeat our success.
However, it was only Charley Pearse, the night-goods
foreman, who had come down to send the
trucks off, and had crossed over to my box to tell
me of a ‘rum go’ he had had with some queer-looking
strangers, who had insisted on searching
the trucks. ‘If they had been civil,’ said Charley,
with a knowing wink and nod, evidently directed
at my companion, ‘I might have told them something
good; but they were preciously uncivil, talking
to me as if I was a nigger or a convict, so I
sent them to the <i>Pike and Perch</i>’—this was a beer-house
some two miles off—‘and so, you know, if
any gent’s in trouble and wants to clear out,
now’s the time.’</p>

<p>It was at once clear that Charley knew, or
pretty closely guessed, what was afoot. The
captain looked anxiously at me. By a sudden
inspiration I saw how to make a benefit of
this new danger. ‘Charley,’ I exclaimed, ‘this
is Captain Laurenston, who thrashed the major.
You know all about him, I am certain, for we
have often talked about the affair.’</p>

<p>Charley nodded.</p>

<p>‘If he does not get away to-night,’ I continued,
‘he will be caught, for there are spies about
him everywhere.’</p>

<p>‘Well, what is the captain going to do?’</p>

<p>‘You can help him, Charley,’ I said. ‘Your
brother goes down with the night-goods, and
I know his wife’s brother is steward aboard the
French packet. Get the captain down with the
goods and smuggle him aboard.—Here! this
will make it worth your while.’ As I said this,
I drew out the watch and chain from my desk
and pushed them towards Charley. His eyes
sparkled, and I saw the business was as good as
done.</p>

<p>Charley made a feeble objection to taking such
valuables; but there was no time for fencing of
this kind, so he picked the treasures up, and left,
telling the captain to go outside and wait under
the signal, as dangerous eyes might be upon the
box.</p>

<p>The captain took his advice, after shaking my
hand, and saying: ‘But what are you going to
have for yourself, Waltress?—Well, never mind,
I will see to that; you know I will do so, I
hope.’</p>

<p>‘One thing is quite certain,’ I replied, ‘that I
would not rob Miss Cleabyrn of her valuables,
if they were a hundredfold as valuable.—Now,
don’t argue, captain; but go and wait where
Charley tells you.’</p>

<p>With another clasp of my hand, he went; and I
was more nervous than I ever remember to have
been before in my life, until the engine came and
commenced ‘shunting;’ and then it was actually
worse. Every moment I fancied I could hear a
struggle, and I thought the engine had never been
half so long over its work. But it went away at
last; and its puffing was still faintly heard in the
distance, when, without the slightest warning, the
door of my hut was thrown open and there were
the strange men again.</p>

<p>The leader exclaimed fiercely: ‘Now you, sir!
where is the man who was here just now? We
are up to your tricks. Where is he?’</p>

<p>‘Hush!’ said one of his companions, and
whispered to him.</p>

<p>‘No proof!’ he exclaimed; ‘the scoundrels are
all in league together. A woman with a man
was seen coming towards this box, and where
are they? We will have them; and you too,
Mr Signalman, if you attempt any tricks upon
us.’</p>

<p>I could see that half-measures or timid words
would not do, so I boldly—in appearance at anyrate,
although I was a good deal frightened—defied
him. I told him point-blank that if I
did know, or could know, where the persons he
wanted were, I should not tell him.</p>

<p>This conduct was the best I could have adopted;
the party were convinced I knew nothing of the
fugitive, and so went away. But after they
were gone, I felt horribly nervous; it had been
so near a thing, that I would not have passed
through the same excitement again for any
money.</p>

<p>Charley and his friends were true to their
trust. This was greatly to their credit, as there
was a large reward out, which they could have
earned by a few words; and <i>they</i> had not been
in love with the captain’s sweetheart, as I had
been. Charley brought me a note on the next
day, written by the captain on board the French
boat, and on the day following I got another from
France; so Laurenston was safe.</p>

<p>I took an early opportunity of seeing Miss
Cleabyrn as she was walking near her home,
when I told her how I had disposed of the
watch and chain. She looked at me with her
old smile, which I remembered so well—remembered
then!—why, I have not forgotten it now!—and
said I must have my own way; but she
would try to find a mode of conciliating even
my disinterestedness; and she did so.</p>

<p>I heard nothing for some few weeks of any
of the parties in the affair which had been so
exciting to me; indeed, Miss Cleabyrn must
have left home directly after the interview I
have just spoken of, for I never saw her again—not
for years, at anyrate. But I had a letter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">{234}</span>
from her, a thing I had never dreamed would
happen to me. It was dated from Boulogne,
where she had arrived, she said, the previous
day; and after thanking me for my services,
and saying that Messrs Primer, her solicitors,
had instructions to write to me, the letter was
signed—I could hardly believe my eyes!—Oswald
Laurenston and Beatrice Laurenston! So the
secret was out!—they were married.</p>

<p>When I recalled the little scene in my hut,
her passionate, unrestrained farewell, I felt that
I ought to have known it then; but, if I may
indulge in a philosophical reflection, I would
say that all through life you are always looking
back and blaming yourself for not having seen
more plainly the things which were passing
before your eyes.</p>

<p>Well, this was nearly the end of my adventure
with Captain Laurenston; yet one or two
incidents which remain to be told were perhaps
as important to me as any that had gone before.
There was at the end of our lane a cottage,
somewhat larger than its neighbours, with quite
a nice piece of ground attached, a great deal
superior, indeed, to the others. To my amazement,
Messrs Primer, of Lincoln’s Inn, sent down
a clerk with the title-deeds of this house and
land, which were actually presented to me as
from Captain Laurenston.</p>

<p>It made my fortune, I may say. I was married
to Patty within six months, and with her I have
been thoroughly happy. But it was many a long
day before I told her as much as I have written
here. The captain and his wife must have had
excellent information from some one in the
neighbourhood of what went on—which was easy
enough, as they were on friendly terms with old
Mr Cleabyrn—for they sent Patty a beautiful silk
dress and an amethyst brooch as wedding presents.</p>

<p>After a good many years, they returned to
England, when Major Starley—who had been
forced to resign—was dead, and the affair had
blown over. They lived a long way off, however,
and I only saw them once or twice. When I
met Mrs Laurenston, leaning on her husband’s
arm, or saw her riding in the pony carriage with
some of her six pretty children, why, I laughed.
But once I could not have laughed.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="ROWING_AT_OXFORD">ROWING AT OXFORD.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Great</span> interest is generally shown throughout the
country about the month of March in the preparations
that are made at our two chief English universities
for the annual boatrace; but few of those
that read the newspaper accounts of the daily
practice of the two crews know how much energy
and time have been devoted by their individual
members to acquiring the skill which will qualify
them for a seat in the ‘’varsity eight.’ Hence
we propose here to give a short account of rowing
at Oxford, and the different college races that a
man has almost invariably taken part in before
he is even tried for ‘the ’varsity.’</p>

<p>The academical year commences with the
October term, and it is in that term that the
majority of freshmen come into residence; accordingly,
this is the time chosen by the captains
of the various college boat-clubs for testing the
rowing capabilities of the freshmen of their college,
and ‘coaching’ all those who wish to go in
for boating. Every afternoon during the greater
part of this term, the captain and other members
of the college eight may be seen standing up
in the stern of ‘tub-pair’ or four, instructing
and exhorting their crews, as they paddle swiftly
down to Ifley lock, or toil up again against the
swollen stream. Towards the end of the term,
the men who have been coached in this way
are formed into regular crews; and after one or
two weeks’ practice together, these crews row
against each other in ‘tub-fours’ for the Silver
Challenge Oars, or some prize given by the
college boat-club.</p>

<p>Passing over to the next, that is the Lent
term, we come to the first eight-oared college
races, which at Oxford are better known as the
Torpids. In these races, the colleges compete
against one another for the honour of first place
or ‘head of the river.’ No man who has rowed
in his college ‘eight’ in the previous year is
eligible to row in his Torpid; the majority of
the crew consist of men who have received
coaching in the October term, and have taken
part in the four-oared races described above.</p>

<p>The first week or two of this term is occupied
by the captain in selecting and arranging
his crew; when that is made up, regular practice
is the order of the day, for the most part
on the stretch of water between Oxford and
Ifley, but occasionally varied by a ‘long course’
to Abingdon, a distance of seven miles. Coaching
is done by members of the ‘eight,’ who run
with the boat along the towpath, shouting at
the top of their voices to the different members
of the crew, and sometimes, when the floods
are out and the towpath is covered, splashing
through water nearly up to their knees. Practice
of this kind is continued daily, no matter
what the weather is, until the races take place,
which is usually about the middle of the term.
Each college is represented by one boat, and in
some cases by two boats, so that there are generally
from twenty to twenty-five boats entered,
and these are divided into two divisions. The
races occupy six days, each division rowing once
each day, the second division always commencing.
The boats are placed one behind the other in
the order in which they left off the year before,
with a clear space of about two boat-lengths
between each. The object aimed at by each
boat is to overtake the boat in front and bump
it. If successful in doing this, these two boats
at once draw out of the way, and leave room
for those following to pass; and on the next day
they change places. The head boat of the second
division is called the ‘Sandwich’ boat, and rows
again the same afternoon at the bottom of the
first division, in this way forming a link by
which a boat may pass from one division to the
other.</p>

<p>Having paddled down to their respective positions,
the boats are turned, and preparations are
made for the race. A line attached to the bank
is held by the cockswain, and this, with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">{235}</span>
assistance of a waterman with a long pole, helps
to keep the boat in position and prevents it
drifting out of its place. Meanwhile, the first
signal-gun has been fired, and the crews are
divesting themselves of jackets and mufflers.
Soon the second gun is heard, and there is now
one minute before the signal to start is given.
What an anxious minute that is, so much
depends upon getting off well, especially with
a crew in which many of the men are rowing
in one of these bumping races for the first time.
A bad start causes flurry and unsteadiness in
the boat, and then there is sometimes a risk of
being bumped before the men settle down
together to a long and even stroke. Bang!
The starting gun has fired, and off go the dozen
or more boats in a long line; the towpath is
crowded with men, running with their respective
college crews, shouting, blowing horns, and
making use of every conceivable instrument of
noise to urge on and encourage their representatives.
By the time the barges, which are
crowded with spectators, are reached, great gaps
will have appeared in the line, as most of the
bumps take place below; though here too, sometimes,
a most exciting race is witnessed, when
some boat, almost overlapped by its rival, is
seen struggling to reach the winning-post without
being bumped. Nor is this bumping so easy as
it might at first seem; but a good deal of skill
is required on the part of the cockswain to effect
it. In the first place, there is always the danger
of making the shot too soon, in which case the
boat, missing the stern of the one in front, shoots
half-way across the river, and thereby loses a
good deal of ground. Again, when one boat is
overlapping another, the cockswain of the first,
by pulling his rudder towards the bow of his
rival, can cause such a wave of water to wash
against the latter as to ward off for a time the
actual bump; then, by a judicious spurt on the
part of his ‘stroke,’ when the rudder is again
straightened, he may be enabled to draw away
and steer his boat in safety past the winning-post.</p>

<p>These races conclude the rowing for this term,
though sometimes the last few days are spent
in coaching the best men from the Torpid on
‘sliding seats,’ by way of preparation for the
next term’s practice for the ‘eight.’</p>

<p>We now come to the summer or May term,
the pleasantest term of all, as far as boating is
concerned. The most important races during
this term are those in which the college eights
compete. They are carried out in exactly the
same manner as the Torpids described above,
the only difference being in the kind of boat
used. The Torpids row in what are called
clinker-built or gig-boats, which have a small
keel, and of which the seats are fixed; whereas
the ‘eights’ are rowed in smooth, keelless boats—the
bottom somewhat resembling that of a small
canoe—and fitted with sliding seats, by which the
stroke can be lengthened and more use made of
the legs. The extremities of the boat are covered
with canvas, to prevent the water washing in over
the side. The crew of a college eight is composed
of the best men the college can muster, all of
course being members of the college.</p>

<p>The races, as we mentioned before, are arranged
in the same way as those in which the Torpids
compete, though perhaps more interest is shown
in the eights; and as they come off at a pleasanter
time of the year, and are undoubtedly
one of the sights of the university, the spectators
include many more strangers. The ’varsity
‘sculls’ and the ’varsity ‘pairs’—the former open
to any member, and the latter to any two
members of the ’varsity boat-club—conclude the
rowing at Oxford for this term; though it
should here be mentioned that two or three
of the boats that have shown themselves above
the average in the eight-oared races, often keep
in practice for Henley regatta, which takes place
soon after the close of this term.</p>

<p>We have now given a brief description of a
year’s college rowing at Oxford, that is, rowing
in which a college crew competes with members
of its own or other colleges. Starting again with
the October term, we propose saying something
about rowing for the ’varsity, the chief event in
which is the annual race with Cambridge. There
is, however, one college race not yet mentioned,
which takes place in the October term—namely,
the ’varsity ‘Fours,’ open to all the colleges.
For this event there are not generally more than
from six to eight boats entered, as considerably
more skill and watermanship are required than
for the college eight. The boats used, though
of much the same construction as the latter, are
of course smaller, and therefore more difficult to
sit; moreover, they do not carry a cockswain,
the steering being done by one of the crew with
his feet, by means of wires connecting the rudder
with a lever attached to his stretcher, so that,
by moving this lever with his foot to one side
or the other, a corresponding motion is given
to the rudder. This race takes place in the first
half of the term, and immediately afterwards the
work of selecting a crew for the inter-university
boatrace is commenced.</p>

<p>With this object in view, the names of two
or three of the best men from each college are
received by the President; and the remaining
weeks of this term are spent in testing on the
river these fifty or sixty men and selecting from
them the best sixteen; these, again, are divided
into two regular crews, which are known by the
name of the ‘Trial Eights.’ A race takes place
at the end of the term between these crews;
they are coached by the President, and their
rowing is carefully watched by him and his
advisers. Those who have displayed the greatest
‘staying-powers’ and the most perfect style, or
are likely to develop into the best ‘oars,’ are
picked out, and, along with any members of the
last year’s crew that may be available, form the
material out of which the ‘’Varsity eight’ is
composed.</p>

<p>The process of selecting the actual crew out
of these men that have been chosen from the
‘Trial Eights,’ and arranging them in the places
they are best fitted to occupy, takes up the first
few weeks of the next or Lent term. Their
strength and ‘staying-powers’ are tested by long
rows to Abingdon and back, and at the same
time they are coached by the President, or by
some ‘old-blue’ who has come up to help him.</p>

<p>By the middle of the term, the crew is generally
settled upon, and on Ash-Wednesday they
go into strict training. The old theories of training
on raw meat, &amp;c., have quite died out; a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">{236}</span>
plentiful supply of plain, well-cooked food is
allowed, but only a very moderate amount of
liquor, and smoking must be entirely knocked
off. For breakfast and dinner the crew meet
together in each other’s rooms, each man entertaining
the rest for one day in turn while they
are still at Oxford. Lunch is only a light meal.
The rowing is almost entirely done during the
afternoon. Ten days or a fortnight before the
time fixed for the race, the crew go up to
Putney to complete their practice on the tidal
water and the course over which the race is to
be rowed. Their doings here and the race itself
need no description in this paper. Their daily
practice on the London water, the time they
occupy in rowing over the course, even their
very movements are watched and recorded by
the daily press. Suffice it to say that this notoriety
is not at all desired by the members of
the crews, and that, owing to the inconvenience
and obstruction it sometimes causes to their practice,
the proposal to hold the race on other
and quieter waters has been more than once
discussed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="A_HOLIDAY_IN_COUNTY_CORK">A HOLIDAY IN COUNTY CORK.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Leap</span> is not a name suggestive of things Irish,
yet the place so called is as pure a specimen
of the primitive Irish village as one might wish
to find. There it was our happiness to spend
a holiday in the summer of 1885. During our
few weeks’ stay we made the acquaintance of a
people whose character and modes of life have
the flavour of an age innocent of the civilities
of the nineteenth century. The village of Leap
is in County Cork, at the extreme south-west
corner of Ireland, about eighteen miles
to the east of Cape Clear, and about forty to
the west of the city of Cork. It stands at the
head of Glandore Bay, one of the numberless
inlets that are so striking a feature of this
part of the Irish coast.</p>

<p>Glandore Bay is itself worth a lengthened
pilgrimage. In Scotland or England it would
have been famous, and would long since have
been a fashionable seaside resort. The transatlantic
steamers cross its mouth at no great
distance; and it is an impressive spectacle
to see them flash across in the darkness, with
all their portholes lit, and at what appears
to be something like railway speed. The village
of Leap is cut in two by a streamlet,
over which a bridge has now been thrown.
Across this stream, we are told, a deer, hard
pressed by the hunters, once took a desperate
leap; hence the name of the village. In former
times, this same stream was the limit of English
law in Ireland. ‘Beyond the Leap,’ it used to be
said, ‘beyond the law.’ And indeed, the country
beyond the Leap is a perfect paradise for outlaws.
The very sight of it is sufficient to deter the
further progress of the most hot-headed officer
of justice. This corner of County Cork, therefore,
was the haunt of pirates, smugglers, and
various outlawed persons. There is no part of
the British isles richer in tales of blood and
adventure. The district retained its lawless
character down to comparatively recent times;
but in modern days, the private manufacture of
a little poteen is the extent of its misdemeanours.</p>

<p>The country surrounding Leap consists of a
hopeless confusion of hills, none of which, however,
have either the shape or the size to give
them any dignity. These hills are in their turn
covered with excrescences in the shape of huge
knolls of all possible contours and sizes. As
the natural vegetation is of a rankness quite
unknown on the other side of the Channel, it
will be imagined that the general aspect of the
country is singularly harsh and wild. Yet this
unpromising region is made to yield surprising
crops of potatoes, and even of grain. From base
to summit, every hill that the spade can scratch
is cultivated. In many cases, indeed, it is but
picking the bones of nature. It is pathetic to
watch the desperate struggles of some poor soul
to ‘bring in’ a piece of new ground. To see
him with his spade and pickaxe, a stranger
might fancy he was rather about to open a
quarry than lay out a field, where he proposes
to rear crops of turnips or potatoes. The
crofts are also of miserable dimensions. Three
or four acres must in the majority of cases
suffice to maintain an entire family. Where,
however, there is any depth of soil, we were
told on the best authority, it has a productiveness
unsurpassed by the best land across the
Channel. But the whole district is vastly over-populated;
and it is extremely difficult to see
how any possible legislation could make the
land yield a comfortable subsistence to the present
numbers of its people. Some years since,
an active emigration went on from the neighbourhood;
but it has now almost ceased. As
illustrative of the tenacity with which the Irishman
clings to his wretched allotment, a land-steward
told us an experience of his employer.
This gentleman was desirous of acquiring a
small croft adjoining his own estate. The rental
may have been equal to about thirty shillings;
and fifty pounds were offered as a liberal price
for the land. The owner thereupon declared that
to no other person would he part with his ground
but to this particular gentleman, and that to
him he would give it for five hundred pounds!
The croft is still in the possession of its hereditary
owner.</p>

<p>It does not seem that the formidable distance
of America keeps them at home, since,
judging by their way of talking, one is led
to believe that they think of New York as
nearer than London or Liverpool. They also
more readily think of strangers as Americans
than Britons. It may be mentioned in this
connection that the most earnest counsel given
to young Irishmen who do emigrate from this
part of the country is to give O’Donovan Rossa
and his associates as wide a berth as possible.
That redoubtable personage was born in Rosscarberry,
a village some five miles to the south-east
of Leap. It was in Skibbereen, a place also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">{237}</span>
in the immediate neighbourhood, that he attracted
the attention of Head-centre Stephens by his outspoken
and bitter hostility to all things English.
We met several persons who knew Rossa well
in his young manhood, and it is but just to
say that they all spoke of him as an upright
and generous fellow. His subsequent career,
however, is spoken of in the neighbourhood in
language anything but complimentary.</p>

<p>At first sight, one would be inclined to say
that the district should at least be well stocked
with game; but the truth is that game of all
kinds is exceedingly scarce. During our stay,
we did not see a single ‘head.’ The extinction
of hares, indeed, can be traced to a very recent
date and a very efficient cause. When the Land
League agitation was at its height a few years
ago, bands of the people, often three or four
hundred strong, mustered every Sunday after
second mass, and scouring the country with dog
and gun, made indiscriminate butchery of everything
in the shape of game that came in their
way. Gamekeeper and policeman, as may be
imagined, kept well out of sight while they
did their work. Next morning, the booty was
on its way to the suspects in Kilmainham jail,
who, during the whole term of their detention,
were regularly catered for.</p>

<p>The cabins of these Cork crofters present
externally a more respectable appearance than
the cabins of the same class in many parts of
the Highlands and islands of Scotland. These
Irish cabins are mostly built of stone, which
in this part of the country is easily obtainable.
Their interior, however, would scarcely satisfy an
exacting sanitary officer. It consists of two apartments,
the upper and the lower. The upper is
the sleeping apartment of the family, and the
lower is the common room of the household and
all the live-stock. There is usually, indeed, a
shed adjoining the house for the special accommodation
of the latter; but there is a constant
intercourse between the two domiciles, and donkeys,
pigs, geese, cocks and hens, sheep, and goats
enjoy quite undefined household privileges. Passing
a cabin one day shortly after our arrival
in the place, we heard an appalling sound, and
immediately afterwards a voice exclaiming: ‘Be
quoite, sir!’ It was a donkey sharing the hearthstone
with his master. The donkey, in truth,
though his master’s dearest possession, would also
seem to be his peculiar torment.</p>

<p>The sanitary officer has found his way even to
this corner of the empire, and objects to the
domestic privileges of donkeys. Like most despised
races, however, donkeys have ineradicable
opinions, and one of these appears to be their prescriptive
right to their master’s domicile. As the
Irishman, however, would seem to incline rather
to the opinion of his donkey than to that of the
sanitary officer, it will be seen that misunderstandings
are apt to arise. The donkey is a still further
source of mischief in that he utterly refuses to
make any distinction between his owner’s ground
and other people’s. He breaks in utter unconcern
through neighbouring fences, and browses at large
at his own caprice. Altogether, the donkey, as
he is found in Ireland, cannot fail to excite
the admiration of the stranger. On the other
side of the Channel he is abroad, and has the
exile’s numbness of feeling. But in Ireland he
is at home; he has the inspiriting sense of a
numerous brotherhood, and one may easily see
that he has a vivid consciousness of his social
importance.</p>

<p>The diet of the Irishman in this part of the
country is, of course, potatoes and milk. As he
himself puts it, he has potatoes twenty-one times
a week. In the event of a blight, such as the
historic one, the result in certain parts of Ireland
could scarcely be less disastrous than at any
former period. If one may judge by the physique
of its consumers, the diet requires no recommendation
of the medical faculty, for a more
stalwart race it would be difficult to find. In
this corner of the country so long ‘preserved,’
we should expect to find the natural Irishman,
and we certainly found him. The native Irish
is almost universally spoken; but at the same
time, the majority of the younger generation
speak English with a brogue of the most exquisite
flavour. Here, also, we have the Irishman in
the typical attire to which caricaturists have
accustomed us. To the visitor from the other
island, it is a ludicrous picture to see him in
tall hat, blue tailed coat, and knee-breeches, at
work in his wretched plot, like a philosopher
out for a little recreation. It is not so much
the style of his garments, however, that makes
their picturesqueness; it is their positively miraculous
raggedness. We feel that this raggedness
has quite passed the stage of disreputability,
and has actually become ornamentation. But it
is above all the hat that fixes the attention.
We have often closely inspected it; and our
wonder never ceased how, in the course of a
single life, any hat, however weather-beaten and
however brutally used, could attain that pre-Adamite
look.</p>

<p>It is the great charm of travel in Ireland
that one can become acquainted with its people
in so short a time and on such easy terms. The
Irishman is the most approachable of human
beings, and as the very Irishman the stranger
wishes to know is in most cases his own lord
and master, intercourse is thus made doubly easy.
If in the course of a solitary walk you should
desire the solace of a little conversation, you
have but to take your seat on one of the turf
walls that form the fences in these parts of the
country. If you are a smoker and produce your
pipe, you will present an additional inducement.
Before you are well seated, you will be saluted
with: ‘A fine day, sir, God be praised!’ and a
careless figure will be seen approaching with
spade or pickaxe over his shoulder. Sharing
your tobacco with him, it will remain with
yourself to conclude the interview. Before ten
minutes have passed, you will have had the
outlines of his family history, and his views on
things in general, not even excepting his priest.
At the end of as many hours’ conversation as
you please, he will speed you on your way
with a fervent ‘God preserve you long!’ and
part with you as if you had been his lifelong
friend.</p>

<p>The peasant women of Cork and Kerry bear
a name for good looks; but their style of dress
certainly does not display their charms to advantage.
The married women of the west of Ireland
wear a long, coarse, black cloak, descending to
their feet, and furnished with a commodious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">{238}</span>
hood which partially envelops their features.
A more ungraceful garment than this cloak it
would be difficult to imagine; and in bright
summer weather it strikes one as the most
perversely unreasonable of all human adornings.
The unmarried women, though disallowed the
use of the cloak, yet contrive to disfigure themselves
with equal success by means of a shawl,
in which they invariably envelop their heads
as well as their shoulders. But in native sweetness
and gracefulness of speech, the Irish countrywoman
leaves her English and Scottish sister
far behind. It is worth the trouble of a hundred
greetings to hear her ‘It is a fine day,
thank God!’ By the way, these greetings sound
very oddly at first in Scottish ears. ‘It is a fine
day, sir, thank God;’ or, ‘It is a fine day, your
honour, the Lord be praised!’ are the ordinary
salutations of the Irish country-people in this
district. Their pious ejaculations occasionally go
beyond this. Speaking with us of the changeable
weather, an old Irishman suddenly exclaimed:
‘May the blessed Son of the Holy Virgin have
mercy on our sowls! but we’re never continted.
When it is wit, we wish it dry; and when it
is dry, we wish it wit.’ On entering their cabins,
it is considered good ‘form’ to say: ‘God preserve
all in this house;’ and the response is:
‘Thank ye kindly, sir (or lady); may God preserve
ye long!’</p>

<p>Life with the Irish crofter is reduced to its
very simplest elements. In summer he dawdles
through a few months’ work; and in winter
he chews the cud of his summer’s exertions.
Sundays and saints’ days alone vary the monotony
of his year. He is a most devout and
regular attender of all religious ordinances; and
no state of the weather will keep him from
eight o’clock mass of a Sunday morning. When
second mass is over, he gives himself up to
secular enjoyment with a freedom unknown
across the Channel. Sunday afternoon, indeed,
is the period when his spirits are at their best,
and according as his humour is for drinking, or
sport, or argument, allows them their fullest
scope. In the part of Ireland of which we are
speaking, drunkenness is certainly rarer than
in most parts of England and Scotland. This
may be partly due to greater moderation, but
it may also be attributed to the drink most
largely patronised. This beverage is known as
‘Clonakilty porter,’ a drink famous throughout
all this part of the country. It is the very
cheapest of all spirituous liquors, and probably
the most innocuous. It would overtax ordinary
powers of credence to specify the quantity disposed
of at one bout by an ordinary man or
woman—for the women have a pronounced liking
for this particular beverage. The potato diet,
though one would not think it, is said to account
for this abnormal drinking capacity; and some
explanation is certainly needed.</p>

<p>The parish priest is, of course, the central
figure of every neighbourhood. As far as an
outsider may judge, the relations of priest and
parishioner would appear to be of the most
cordial nature. The kindly feeling is doubtless
fostered by the fact that the priests as a class
come of the small farmers of the country. Their
own early training, therefore, expressly fits them
for dealing with their people. It cannot be
gainsaid that the priests as a body look exceedingly
good fellows, and invariably have that
prosperous appearance that betokens happy relations
with ourselves and others. During our
stay in Leap, we witnessed a very pleasing proof
of this mutual good understanding between the
priest and his people. The priest of the village
was returning from a holiday in England, and
his parishioners took the opportunity of showing
their esteem and affection for him. The houses
of the village were all decked with flowers, and
flags suspended across the streets bearing various
inscriptions in English and Irish, such as,
‘Welcome home, our worthy priest,’ &amp;c. As
the reverend gentleman approached, he was met
by a large body of his people on foot, on
donkeys, on horses, and in cars. His horse was
taken out of the traces, and his vehicle drawn
into the village by a number of young men
amid immense enthusiasm of the entire population.
At night, the village was brilliantly illuminated,
a candle being set in every pane, and
paper lanterns suspended at various corners of
the street. Later, a burning tar-barrel was borne
through the street, the priest himself heading
the procession; and the proceedings closed by
his addressing his assembled flock from his own
doorstep. Judged by the frequent and obstreperous
applause of his hearers, his address would
seem to have met their fervent approval. It is
only in political demonstrations that Scotsmen
exhibit similar unanimity; and the entire proceedings
seemed in our Scottish eyes a pleasant
novelty in things religious.</p>

<p>Few of the people in the district have been
beyond their native parish, and the priest is for
the majority of them the reservoir of all secular
as well as spiritual knowledge. He conveys
instruction to them on all subjects, and on
Sundays often closes his ministrations with hints
of practical bearing on their temporal concerns.
During one of the weeks of our stay in the
neighbourhood, a mad dog got at large, and
wrought considerable mischief on man and beast.
Indeed, the achievements of this dog would
furnish material for a history of some length.
On Sunday, after the celebration of mass, the
priest made reference to the wonderful doings
of this dog. He began by saying that if any
one had a dog that should go mad, his best
plan was at once to shoot it; and he proceeded
to explain minutely the various methods of
treating a bitten person. This reference to the
event of the week was evidently taken quite
as a matter of course; and one could easily
gather that the importance of local events is
measured by the style of the priest’s reference
to them on Sundays.</p>

<p>The old Irish style of conducting funerals is
still in vogue in this district, though among the
more respectable classes it is falling into disuse.
During our stay, we saw one of these old-fashioned
funerals. Heading the procession was
a dogcart with the driver and the priest—the
priest, of course, intricately enwrapt in white
linen, of which, by the way, he usually receives
a fresh suit from the relatives of the deceased.
Then followed a common cart strewn with straw,
containing the coffin and the chief mourner, who
on this occasion was a woman. She was clad in
the ordinary dress of her class; and with hood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">{239}</span>
drawn closely over her face and chin resting on
her knees, she <i>keened</i> in the most dismal manner.
Immediately behind the cart came a crowd of
women similarly attired, and all <i>keening</i>, though
in rather a mechanical and half-hearted fashion.
Then followed a straggling concourse of men, all
on foot, in their workaday garb, and with faces
unwashed. These made no demonstration whatsoever.
The rear was brought up by a number of
young men, sons, perhaps, of well-to-do farmers,
also in their ordinary dress. They lounged on in
the easiest fashion, with hands in pockets, their
waistcoats open—the day was hot—and certain of
them actually smoking. The Celtic races have
the reputation for natural delicacy of feeling.
In such exhibitions as the above, this delicacy
certainly does not show itself.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="PEAT_AS_A_MANURE">PEAT AS A MANURE.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> advice has been given to those who wish
to make something out of their peat-mosses, that
their best course is just to let them alone, as
the more they are interfered with, the greater
the loss will be; but this Lord Melbourne ‘Why-can’t-you-let-it-alone’
way of treating every subject
may be occasionally overdone. The writer
having of late years been utilising the peat on
his farm, and being greatly satisfied with the
result, now ventures to give a short sketch of
his operations.</p>

<p>He has a small hill-farm, where, in byres<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and
covered closes, he winters a breeding-stock of
about fifty cattle, of different ages, and having
only, on an average, about forty acres in white-crop;
and as straw in the neighbourhood is difficult
to buy, he was occasionally pinched both
for fodder and bedding. For reasons which need
not here be stated, he does not wish to diminish
the number of the cattle so wintered. This being
the state of matters, and being exercised how
to make his fodder and bedding last through the
winter, it occurred to the writer that he might
greatly economise his bedding, and so the more
easily get over the winter, were he to use a quantity
of peat in the closes and byres. He happens
to be favourably situated, having an abundant
supply of peat of a fine grain within a short
distance of the steading. The cost of cutting
and bringing a fair cartload—about fifteen hundredweight—to
the steading he calculates at
about sixpence. Thus, by putting on three carts,
three men, and a boy—two of these cutting and
filling, and two going with the carts—he can
deliver at the peat-shed about forty-five carts
per day, or about thirty-five tons. As the bog
grows good grass, the turf is lifted, and is relaid
on the lower level. In this way the carts can
in dry weather be backed up to the face of the
peat.</p>

<p>The peat-harvest is commenced after the turnips
are in, as not only the horses have then little
work to do, but especially as at that time of the
year the bog and its approaches are dry. He
has then fully two hundred and fifty loads taken
from the bog. A portion is heaped up at the
back of a wall near the steading, for use in
autumn and early winter; but the greater part is
stored in sheds. Being thus stored and kept dry,
and exposed as much as possible to the summer
sun and winds, it forms, when put into the closes,
a dry comfortable bed for the cattle, and acts
as a sponge, absorbing the liquid manure, and
thus storing away the ammonia. Further, as
in some places the bog is too soft for carts to
go into, the writer, each summer and autumn,
has some two hundred tons harrowed out on
to hard ground, piled into as high a heap as
possible, and allowed to remain until the following
summer, when it is found to be dry, and
easily carted. The cost of such wheeling-out
is about fivepence per ton.</p>

<p>In autumn, after the manure which has lain
in the closes all the summer has been carted
out, the floor of the closes is covered with some
twelve or fifteen inches of moss, sprinkled over
with straw or bracken. The cattle, when first
put in, appear to dread putting foot on the peat;
but in a short time become quite accustomed to
it. In about ten days, the closes get another
dressing of some five inches of peat, covering
slightly with straw, as before. It might be
supposed that with so much moss and so little
straw, the cattle would <i>lair</i>; but this is not so,
unless on the first day or two. On the contrary,
the manure-bed is firm and elastic under
foot. The above dressings are continued all
through the winter and spring, the consequence
being that the ammonia and other chemicals,
instead of being evaporated detrimentally to
the health of the cattle, are stored away and
preserved. The air in the closes is sweet and
wholesome. Pigs do not crinkle in their legs
by boring in over-heated manure—a very common
complaint in covered closes—the feet of the
cattle are kept cool, a necessary condition, if one
looks for perfect health, and which can only be
imperfectly got in a straw-bedded covered close
by frequent removals of the manure. The water-supply
to the closes—should the pipe lie below
the manure—is kept perfectly cool, instead of
being tepid, as the writer has seen it.</p>

<p>When the writer began to use peat, he rather
thought that there would not be a perfect amalgamation—that,
when the closes came to be
emptied, he should find several distinct layers
of peat, possibly difficult of removal. As a
matter of fact, the peat placed in the floor
of the close alone retains its identity; <i>it</i> certainly
comes out peat the same as when it was
put in, but apparently <i>plus</i> a large percentage of
ammonia, of which it smells strongly. As to
the other peat put on in layers, it almost totally
disappears; but the whole manure is black and
compact. Last autumn, peat taken from the
floor of the closes was put on a piece of stiff,
poor clay-ground, part of a lea-field which was
being ploughed for a crop of oats. The result
is very satisfactory, the corn on such part being
very healthy and strong.</p>

<p>The result of such peat operations is, that a
good supply of bedding is provided, the cattle
are kept in a more healthy state, and there
is a large extra quantity of excellent manure
obtained at a cost of under one shilling per ton.
The turnip crops grown with such manure and
a little phosphate have been perfectly satisfactory.
The writer’s byres are under the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">{240}</span>
roof as the closes, and drain into them. Peat
is freely used in them, especially behind the
cows—the result being that much of the liquid
manure is sucked into the peat, and thus not
only the atmosphere of the byres is sweetened,
but the drainage is more easily managed.</p>

<p>Any farmer having a peat-bog on his farm,
can with very little trouble prove the truth of
what is here stated.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="ABSENCE_OF_MIND">ABSENCE OF MIND.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> his <i>Voyage autour de ma Chambre</i>, De Maistre
discusses the very curious phenomenon of the
independence of the mind and the body. He
tells us how, in a fit of absent-mindedness, he
often drew on his stockings wrong side out, and
had to be reminded by his invaluable servant
Joannetti of his mistake. Many readers will
call to mind experiences of their own of a similar
nature. It seems quite common to put one’s
watch-key to one’s ear to ascertain if it is
going; and many people are in the habit of
winding their watches, and three minutes after,
pausing to wonder whether they have done so
or not.</p>

<p>Who has not heard of the philosopher who
boiled his watch while he calmly held the egg
in his hand to note the time! Or of the equally
erudite man of science, who, having peeled the
apple, threw the apple itself over a cliff, and then
discovered that the rind alone remained!</p>

<p>Another individual had the habit—not such
a very uncommon one—of forgetting his own
name at awkward moments. One day he presented
himself at the post-office for letters, when,
much to his disgust, he could not think of his
name. He turned sadly homewards, racking his
brains in the vain endeavour to discover who
he was. Suddenly a friend accosted him: ‘How
are you, Mr Brown?’—‘Brown, Brown, I have
it!’ cried the absent-minded one; and leaving
his astonished friend, he rushed back to the
post-office to get his letters.</p>

<p>Sometimes absence of mind produces very
ludicrous effects. Harry Lorrequer’s appearance
on parade in the character of Othello is well
known. A somewhat similar occurrence in real
life happened not long ago. A student on
leaving his rooms one afternoon to take a stroll
in the fashionable street in a university town,
suddenly remembered that his fire needed coals,
and returned to replenish it. On issuing from
his lodging the second time, he was surprised
to see people looking at him with an amused
smile. Presently, some ragamuffins at a street
corner began to make audible remarks. On
looking down, he discovered, to his horror, that
he was serenely carrying the fire-tongs in place
of his umbrella!</p>

<p>One day an English savant wrote two letters,
one to a business house in London, the other
to a friend in Paris. In stamping them at the
post-office, he placed the penny stamp on the
letter for Paris, and the other on the business
letter. Remarking to the post-office clerk that
he would correct the error, he changed the
addresses! It was not till after he had posted
the letters that he understood why the clerk
had not been more impressed with his brilliant
idea.</p>
